To contribute to ecryptfs (kernel space):
 1) You can typically develop fixes against Linus' tree
    - git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
    However, new features should be developed against linux-next
    - git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git
 2) Make your changes, signoff, and commit, following the guidelines in:
    - http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=blob_plain;f=Documentation/SubmittingPatches;hb=HEAD
 3) Create a proper patch using
    - git format-patch
 4) As SubmittingPatches suggests, please do a style check with
    scripts/checkpatch.pl, which can be found in the kernel source tree
    - http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=blob_plain;f=scripts/checkpatch.pl;hb=HEAD
 5) It is common for first time contributors to use a mail client that mangles
    patches so you may want to verify that there are no known issues with the
    client that you use
    - http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=blob_plain;f=Documentation/email-clients.txt;hb=HEAD
 6) Email your patch inline with, at least, the following headers:
    To: tyhicks@canonical.com
    Cc: ecryptfs@vger.kernel.org
