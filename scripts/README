validate-dir.sh
 - Makes sure that the script is in the right directory before
   delete-cruft.sh gets primeval on the directory contents

sync-kernel.sh
 - Synchronizes the code in linux-git/ with the code in
   ecryptfs-kernel-git/
 - Copies kernel source into latest kernel branch in git (for now,
   it's 2.6.18-mm1)
 - Applies backpatches to get to prior kernel versions
 - Applies netlink hack patch (in case kernel netlink.h does not
   #define NETLINK_ECRYPTFS)
 - Run from a directory containing both linux-git/ and
   ecryptfs-kernel-git/

build-full-tarball.sh
 - Generates a single tarball with both kernel and userspace trees
 - Makes a file ecryptfs-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2
 - Run from a directory containing both ecryptfs-util-git/ and
   ecryptfs-kernel-git/

build-tarball.sh
 - Generates just a userspace utility tarball
 - Pass version number as command-line parameter
 - Run from a directory containing ecryptfs-util-git/

make.sh
 - Builds and installs the trees generated by build-full-tarball.sh
 - Run from directory containing both ecryptfs-util/ and
   ecryptfs-kernel/


PROCEDURES

Update kernel code
 - Apply patches to ecryptfs-kernel-git/ecryptfs code
 - Add new code modifiers in config.h.in and configure.in, along with
   corresponding #ifdef blocks in the eCryptfs code, to account for
   older kernel versions
